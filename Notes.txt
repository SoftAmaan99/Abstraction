Abstraction:
1.The process of representing the essential features without including the
background details is called Abstraction.

2.In simple words, we can say that it is a process of defining a class by
providing necessary details to call the object operations (i.e. methods) 
by hiding its implementation details is called abstraction in C#.

3.It means we need to expose what is necessary and compulsory and we need 
to hide the unnecessary things from the outside world.

Note:-Abstraction lets you focus more on what an object does rather 
than how it does.
